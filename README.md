# Short Telegram Bot

> Documentation status: versioned public baseline with explicitly separated production and historical release overlays.

## Source of truth

Start with [`docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`](docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md). The public checkout is baseline commit `ce77d744`; the operator-reported production release is Lane A `bf47d2b1` from 2026-09-14, and Lane B `dfcdb9df` from 2026-09-17 is historical/experimental. The latter two release artifacts are not Git objects in this shallow public clone.

The repository is a signal and research system. It does not place live orders, enable copy-trading, or provide autoexecution. Ordinary short notifications are manual-entry only. `EARLY_DROP_WARNING` and `WATCH` are non-actionable and never enter ordinary short admission.

A Bybit USDT-perpetual market-monitoring bot that detects short-side reversal and exhaustion setups, persists decisions in SQLite, and delivers human-readable Telegram alerts. **It is a signal and research system, not an order-execution engine.**

## Status

- Runtime: asynchronous single-process poller
- Market data: Bybit REST, closed-candle aware feature pipeline
- Storage: SQLite with WAL and durable Telegram outbox
- Execution: no order placement; `AUTOEXECUTION=OFF`
- Live V1 strategies: `BASELINE_PULLBACK`, `VOLUME_CLIMAX_UNWIND`, `LOW_VOLUME_EXTENSION_FAILURE`
- `TRAPPED_LONGS_REVERSAL`: evaluation/shadow contour; live Telegram delivery remains disabled
- WATCH candidates: non-actionable by default

## Strategies

| Strategy | Role | Default delivery |
|---|---|---|
| `BASELINE_PULLBACK` | Mature post-pump pullback inside the configured short zone | Live |
| `VOLUME_CLIMAX_UNWIND` | High-volume exhaustion with unwind/rejection evidence | Live |
| `LOW_VOLUME_EXTENSION_FAILURE` | Weak extension, low volume efficiency and failed high | Live |
| `TRAPPED_LONGS_REVERSAL` | Experimental trapped-long reversal hypothesis | Shadow only |

The authoritative strategy contracts and invariants are in [`docs/STRATEGIES.md`](docs/STRATEGIES.md). Do not infer profitability from score or grade alone.

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_once.py
```

Run the service loop only after reviewing configuration and delivery policy:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_live.py
```

## Quality gates

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q app scripts tests
.venv/bin/ruff check app scripts tests
```

## Configuration and data hygiene

- `config.example.yaml` is the safe tracked template.
- Real `config.yaml`, `.env`, databases, WAL/SHM files, logs and generated reports stay outside Git.
- Never commit Telegram tokens, API keys, private keys, passwords, chat exports or connection strings.
- The repository deliberately contains no production SQLite database.
